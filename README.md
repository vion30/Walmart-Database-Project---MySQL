# Walmart Database Project - MySQL

## Overview

This project focuses on creating and managing a database for Walmart's sales data using Microsoft SQL Server. The purpose is to provide the Walmart data science team with a sample database to analyze sales trends, understand the impact of holidays on sales, and manage essential business metrics. This project demonstrates database design, data insertion, updates, and analysis through SQL.
## Key Features

* Database design tailored to Walmart's sales data structure.
* Data insertion and updates based on a provided dataset.
* Holiday week identification and sales impact analysis.
* Insights into weekly sales trends, including highest and lowest sales.
* ER diagram creation for database visualization.
* Queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
## Technology Used

* Database Management System: Microsoft SQL Server
* Programming Language: SQL
* Dataset Format: CSV
* Documentation: PDF for project explanation and instructions
## Installation

1. Ensure Microsoft SQL Server is installed on your machine.
2. Download the project files from this repository:
   SQL file: Day 26 Project.sql
   Dataset: Day26Dataset.csv
   Project documentation: Day 26 Project.pdf
3. Open Microsoft SQL Workbench.
4. Load the SQL file (Day 26 Project.sql) in the query editor.
5. Ensure the dataset (Day26Dataset.csv) is in an accessible    location for bulk insertion.
## Run

1. Execute the following steps in SSMS:
   - Run the SQL script to create the database and tables.
   - Insert data into the database from the provided CSV file.
2. Perform specific operations:
   - Delete data for 12-11-2010.
   - Update the Holiday_Flag column values to replace 1 with     
     Holiday and 0 with Non-Holiday.
   - Identify the highest and lowest weekly sales using SQL  
     queries.
   - Use SELECT statements to verify all operations.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates efficient database management and analysis using Microsoft SQL Server. It provides actionable insights into sales trends and holiday impacts, which are critical for business decision-making. Future work may include integrating advanced data visualization techniques or expanding the dataset to include more variables for deeper analysis.
